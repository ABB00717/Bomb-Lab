# Decompiled Bomb Lab

This is a [Bomb Lab from CS:APP](https://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/labs.html) I reversed. it recompiles perfectly and works exactly as expected.

## Build

```
$ cd reference_c_code && make # builds ./bomb
```

```
./bomb answer.txt     # Feeds all lines from answer.txt, then falls back to stdin
./bomb                # Interactive: type one answer per line
```

Remeber to `make clean` if you're done.
